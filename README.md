# Jtalk-Rack

This is a Rack app that serves [Jtalk](http://jtalk-project.org/) and
saves code via [RackDAV](https://github.com/georgi/rack_dav).


## Setup and Usage

First, install all the needed gems:

    rake setup

Then, start up the server:

    rake server

(A shortcut for those last two commands is: `rake && rake`)

Now open http://localhost:9292 in a browser.
